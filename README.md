# Computer_Graphics
 
This repository consists in four projects submitted for Computer Graphics (2020/2021), a curricular subject of CS Degree at IST.
All of the projects are different but they all use the same library Three.js to test different techniques of Computer Graphics and apply them in 3D environments.

P1 - Model of a Mobile (a form of kinetic art) that applies the following key concepts: geometric object manipulation and movement; ortographic camera perspective; object hierarchy in Three.js.

P2 - Interactive Billiard table simulation that allows the player to select and different cues in order to 'shoot' the balls on top of the table. Key concepts: Dynamic Camera; collision detection and response; Orthographic and Perspective camera.

P3 - Cybertruck Model with interactive lights and car materials. Key concepts: manipulation and creation of polygon mesh; Basic, Phong and Lambert mesh materials; Directional and Spot lights.

P4 - Interactive golf field model. Key concepts: point light; multiple scenes; textures; orbit controls; skybox.

All of these projects were in cooperation with [@Mokita-J](https://github.com/Mokita-J) and [@MargaridaMoreira](https://github.com/MargaridaMoreira). ðŸ˜„
